<h1> ultimate-warfare </h1>
<p>A raw but playable game made with löve</p>
<h2> about </h2>
<p>It is a small two player fight game created to make my hand with löve.
Even if I had more idea on it ( weapon, graphics, networking ...) it is no longer updated... for the moment ?<br>The code has been quickly finished as I moved to another project, you may found some nasty line, please be conciliant and don't judge me.</p>
<h2> play</h2>
<p>download with the download ZIP button one the right toolbar
<ul>
	<li><h3>Linux</h3>
	<p> install löve version 0.9 : in Ubuntu/Debian : <code>sudo apt-get install love</code><br>play with <code>love ultimate-warfare.love</code></p></li>
	<li><h3>Windows</h3>
	<p> go to the windows directory, 32 or 64 depends of your processor and find the ultimate-warfare.exe</p></li>
	<li><h3>Mac OS X</h3>
	<p> check in *.app directory if there is something for you, don't really know how it works</p></li>
</ul>
<h2> Issue</h2>
<p> For any please inform me here <a href>https://github.com/thiolliere/ultimate-warfare/</a>, I'll be happy to fix it and make a fullfonctionnal release... if I succed in it.</p>
