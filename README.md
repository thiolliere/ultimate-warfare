<h1> ultimate-warfare </h1>
<p>A raw but playable game made with löve</p>
<h2> about </h2>
<p>It is a small two player fight game created to make my hand with löve.
Even if I had more idea on it ( weapon, graphics, networking ...) it is no longer improved... for now.<br>The code has been quickly finished as I moved to another project, you may found some nasty line, please be conciliant and don't judge me.</p>

	<li><h3>Windows</h3>
	<p> go to the windows directory, 32 or 64 depends on your processor and find the ultimate-warfare.exe</p></li>
	<li><h3>Mac OS X</h3>

</ul>
