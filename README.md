about
----------------------------------------
It is a small two player fight game created to make my hand with löve.
Even if I had more idea on it (weapon, graphics, networking ...) it is no longer improved... for now.
The code has been quickly finished as I moved to another project, you may found some nasty line, please be conciliant and don't judge me.
