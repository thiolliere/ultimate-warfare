# ultimate-warfare
A raw but playable game made with löve

It is a small versus fighting game created to make my hand with löve.
Even if I had more idea on it ( weapon, graphics, networking ...) it is no longer updated... for the moment ?

The code has been quickly finished as I moved to another project, you may found some nasty line, please be conciliant and don't judge me.

INSTALL 

1- build dependencies : löve version 0.9 
on ubuntu : sudo apt-get install love
or can be found there https://love2d.org/

2- download the source available at https://github.com/thiolliere/ultimate-warfare

PLAY

love ./ultimate-warfare/
or ./execute.bash
