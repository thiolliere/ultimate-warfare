ultimate-warfare 
=======================================
A raw but playable game made with löve

about
----------------------------------------
It is a small two player fight game created to make my hand with löve.
Even if I had more idea on it (weapon, graphics, networking ...) it is no longer improved... for now.
The code has been quickly finished as I moved to another project, you may found some nasty line, please be conciliant and don't judge me.

install
----------------------------------------
download with the download ZIP button one the right toolbar

* Linux  
install löve version 0.9 : in Ubuntu/Debian : `sudo apt-get install love`  
and play with : `love ultimate-warfare.love`

* Windows   
go to the windows directory, 32 or 64 depends on your processor and find the ultimate-warfare.exe

* Mac OS X  
check in ultimate-warfare-osx.zip if there is something for you, don't really know how it works

play
----------------------------------------
* red : move with `up, down, left, right` change weapon and shoot respectively `!, rshift `
* blue : move with `z, s, q, d` use your guns with `lshift, lctrl `

issue
----------------------------------------
For any please inform me [here](https://github.com/thiolliere/ultimate-warfare/), I'll be happy to fix it and make a fullfonctionnal release... if I succed in it. <sub>gameplay issue may be used to mad your opponent</sub>
